# MNIST_Digits_Classification_Neural_Net_TEST
This is a project I worked on to further my knowledge about Neural Networks and deep learning. The model I have created produces an accuracy of around 97%. While the results might seem good, there is a possibility of overfitting, indicating the need for further refinement and optimization to enhance its performance.
